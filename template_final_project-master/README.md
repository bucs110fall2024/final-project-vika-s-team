## Project Description

I will create a pet simulator. I could make different pets (dog, cat, bunny...) that users can choose from and then perform functions with. The pet could change its appearance depending on its mood (look happy after feeding, sad if you don't). The user will be able to feed and pet the animal, put the animal to sleep, possibly do trivia games and a simple scrolling game. I could add daily tasks and create achievements.
